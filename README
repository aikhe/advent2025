Advent of Code 2025

Not really sure why im doing all of this, but one thing im confident 
about is that I really love solving problems using code so why the
fuck not just sit down and do all of this. But you know what... since
im gonna learn java anyways, why not just just learn and use it to
solve this? and maybe implement some DSA concept too.

So the goal is to:
- Learn about Java and DSA as much as possible just to be happy
- Actually code everything I've learned so It can actually stick
- Go deep just like how deep I am with my own delusions
- Just do it for the love of god

See https://adventofcode.com/2025 for the problems.
